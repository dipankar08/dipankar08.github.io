C. PROVISION OF THE APP

The App does not host, display or transmit any content owned by third parties on its servers, unless We either have a license or are not prohibited under the applicable law, to do the same. When You read a summary, You may be linked to one of the online sources of such duly aggregated summary, upon tapping “More” tab on Your screen. You agree and acknowledge that the App does not report and/or broadcast any content on its own accord and "D Software Solution" is not responsible or liable for the content or accuracy of the summary of content that may be accessed by You through the App.

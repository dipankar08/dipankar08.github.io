We take great pride in the quality of the content created by us and are very particular about the content displayed on our app and. To ensure consistently high quality of content. we have developed strict editorial guidelines, key features of which are highlighted below.

1. Sourcing from multiple sources:
A. We verify the facts stated in each story from at least three sources thereby ensuring their accuracy
B. Our creators read several articles on each story, distil the common facts which emerge and then create original content for the story.
C. This practice of sourcing from multiple article helps ensure that our story do not reflect the views from one news source and are unbiased and un-opinionated.


2. Multiple layers of review:
A. We make sure that every story goes through multiple layers of review. The first is a self-review process whereby the creator of the story reviews each story based
on a carefully designed internal checklist which ensures that the story meets the language, grammar, plagiarism and content guidelines.
B. At the second layer of review, a content editor again ensures that each of the guidelines is met.
C. Along the way, we also use state-of-the-art anti-plagiarism software which introduces another layer of review to ensure that no improper content sneaks
through.
D. To constantly keep making our review process better, we, in May 2016, introduced an additional layer of review called SGF (spelling, grammar and fact) check to ensure that all our Shorts are error free to the extent possible.


3. We take plagiarism seriously:
A. We believe in being creative instead of being copycats. Plagiarism is simply not acceptable and any violation is not tolerated.
B. We strive to use only such content as is licenced to us by our many content partners and in solely the manner agreed upon in the terms of the licence granted by them.
C. We apply high anti-plagiarism standards and flag use of even three consecutive words from the source as potential plagiarism. Of course, if these three consecutive words form part of a direct quote, then we do not consider it to be plagiarism.
